Our project, InspirED, is dedicated to making sure all students have access to quality education and resources. Over 250 million children do not have access to quality education or an educational facility, highlighting the importance of this problem. All students deserve quality education, and through InspirED, we hope to achieve this. InspirED is a friendly, educational AI chatbot, providing students from ages 9 to 15 access to quality supplemental curricula and educational resources. Transitioning from elementary school to middle school can be very challenging for many students, and the InspirED Assistant can assist students in their educational journey and progress in an inclusive, fun way.

However, our chat-bot is intended for both students and teachers—teachers and parents may also utilize it to get extra support and ideas for their students and children. 

Our chatbot encourages equal education by providing students the same access to high-quality education and enabling each student to learn at their own pace, tailored to their needs. It also provides information on the importance of quality education as well as InspirED’s mission to raise awareness for this important cause.
